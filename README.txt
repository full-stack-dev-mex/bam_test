== Description ==

Please try to accomplish the following:
Implement a plugin of a basic Ad System for WordPress for authors to add, edit, and remove ads. 

Each ad has the following attributes:

* Type
* Template
* Title
* Background Color

Ads should be easily reusable in different pages or posts, easily placed anywhere within the content, and it should be easy to modify the attributes of every instance (site-wide) of the same ad. The title of an ad can also be customized on a per-instance basis; this means that two cases of the same ad can have different titles, for example. If an advertisement is used on a post, and the post belongs to one of the following categories, the default background color of the ad should change automatically:

* NFL: black
* NBA: orange
* MLB: blue

Additionally, implement a specific template of an ad of type Pick, based on the attached Photoshop design. The countdown can be static; it doesn’t have to count down.

Notes:

Make sure the design of the template is responsive.
The quality of the back-end and front-end code will be considered as much as the attention to detail shown in the delivered design, and how easy it will be for authors to use.
Do not use design toolkits like Bootstrap, as we would like to see how you code this from scratch.
Deliver the task by pushing the code to your Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket, and sending us the link.
Make it as easy as possible for us to test your solution.
Bonus features:The following features are not necessary, but it would be nice to see and will award you bonus points.

Make the “remaining time” customizable.
Make the countdown count down.
